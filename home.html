			<h2>Overview</h2>	
				<p> Hi there! My name is Sarah and I am currently enrolled in the Beginner HTML and CSS class at The Starter League on Wednesday nights.  During the day, you'll find me at JPMorgan Chase, helping out their Middle Market Finance team with planning and analysis.  Originally, from Kentucky (GO CATS!), I moved up here six years ago for work and have loved it every since.  When not working, or creating awesome websites (ha) you'll probably find me outside somewhere-love to run/bike on the lakefront path, get dinner/drinks on a patio in the summertime...you get the idea :)
				</P>
