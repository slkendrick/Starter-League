			<p> Wow,I can't believe its been a little less than two weeks since I started class! Its definitely overwhelming, but I love when ,after trying for <strong>so</strong> long, it finally all comes together, and I can see my work in the browser! It's also been really cool to see all the neat ideas people have for starter night, and to be be inspired by amazing developers like Dylan Richard!

				<ul>
					<li>basical html stucture </li>
					<li>basic css terms</li>
					<li>how to create an index.html </li>
